# data analysis using python
The code provided is written in Python and uses several libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sqlalchemy. The code defines a class called "regression," which includes several methods for performing regression analysis.

The first method, "MatchIdeal," takes two pandas data frames as input: f_training and f_ideal. The method calculates the least squares (LS) value between each column of the f_training data frame and each column of the f_ideal data frame. The LS value is the sum of the squared differences between the values in the two columns, divided by the number of rows in the f_training data frame. The method returns a pandas data frame that lists the index of the column in the f_ideal data frame that best matches each column of the f_training data frame, as well as the corresponding LS value.

The second method, "MatchingRows," takes a single pandas data frame as input: f_test. The method calculates the LS value between the first column of the f_test data frame and each of the other columns. If the LS value is less than (sqrt(2))*0.8, the method considers the column to be a good match, and records the index of the column in the f_ideal data frame that best matches the f_test column. If the LS value is greater than or equal to (sqrt(2))*0.8, the method records "Miss" as the index of the best-matching column. The method returns the f_test data frame with two additional columns: "DIV_" and "Ideal_Index."

The third method, "PlottingGraphs," takes three pandas data frames as input: functionX, functionY1, and functionY2. The method plots the values in the second column of functionX against the values in the specified columns of functionY1 and functionY2. The method takes two additional parameters: ParameterX specifies the column of functionX to use for the x-axis, and ParameterY1 and ParameterY2 specify the columns of functionY1 and functionY2 to use for the y-axis. The method also takes an optional parameter, Plot_show_, which specifies whether to display the plot (default) or not.

The fourth method, "CreatTableDB," is a subclass of "regression." This method takes three parameters: a list of pandas data frames (df), a database name (DBNM), and a table name (TNM). The method creates a SQLite database using the specified name and connects to the database. The method then writes each data frame in the list to a separate table in the database, using the specified table name. If a table with the specified name already exists in the database, the method raises an exception.

The code also includes several lines of code that create three pandas data frames (tr, Idl, and te) by reading data from CSV files. The code then uses the "MatchIdeal" method to find the best match in the Idl data frame for each column of the tr data frame. The code then uses the "PlottingGraphs" method to plot each column of the tr data frame against the corresponding column of the Idl data frame. The code then merges four subsets of the Idl data frame with the te data frame and uses the "MatchingRows" method to identify the best match in the merged data frame for each row. Finally, the code creates a SQLite database using the "CreatTableDB" method and writes the three data frames to separate tables in the database.
